'''Michael Kojo Essien''' (born 3 December 1982) is a Ghanaian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[midfielder]] and currently a part of [[Danish Superliga]] club [[FC Nordsjælland]]'s Player /coaching staff. He has also been capped for the [[Ghana national football team|Ghana national team]] more than 50 times.

Essien started his career playing for [[Liberty Professionals F.C.|Liberty Professionals]] in Ghana. In 2000, he moved to France to join [[SC Bastia|Bastia]], where he would spend three seasons and appear in over 60 matches before joining [[Ligue 1]] title holders [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in 2003. At Lyon, Essien won back-to-back league titles in [[2003–04 Ligue 1|2003–04]] and [[2004–05 Ligue 1|2004–05]], and won [[Trophées UNFP du football#Player of the Year|Ligue 1 Player of the Year]] in 2005. During his five-year stint in France, he acquired French citizenship. In 2005, Essien signed with [[Premier League]] side [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a £24.4&amp;nbsp;million transfer fee and, at the time of his signing, was the most expensive African footballer in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Vickers |title=Michael Essien |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1351_afr_foot_vote/page4.shtml |work=BBC World Service |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |year=2007 |accessdate=24 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Chelsea, Essien helped the club win the Premier League in [[2005–06 FA Premier League|2006]] and [[2009–10 Premier League|2010]], as well as three [[FA Cup]]s and one [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]. He won the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League in 2012]], while also placing as runner up in the [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|2008 UEFA Champions League]]. He has won the [[Chelsea Player of the Year|Chelsea Goal of the Season]] award twice, in the 2006–07 and 2008–09 seasons.

Essien is a former Ghanaian international. At youth level, he represented his country at the [[1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship]] and [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]], with the latter team finishing as runner-up. Essien made his senior team debut in January 2002 and has represented his nation at three [[Africa Cup of Nations]] tournaments. Essien has also represented Ghana at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]s.

==Early life==
Born in [[Accra]] to Aba Gyandoh and James Essien, Essien attended Gomoa Nyanyano DC Primary and JSS. He began his football career after graduating from [[St. Augustine's College (Cape Coast)|St. Augustine's College]] in [[Cape Coast]], playing at a local club called [[Liberty Professionals F.C.|Liberty Professionals]].

Essien broke through when he played in the [[1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=&quot;fifa 1999&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/comp/PrevSquad/0,4355,GHA-U17-1999-3611-19,00.html |title=New Zealand 1999 – Team:Ghana |accessdate=2007-04-05 |publisher=FIFA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307083804/http://www.fifa.com/en/comp/PrevSquad/0%2C4355%2CGHA-U17-1999-3611-19%2C00.html |archivedate=7 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; European scouts began to take notice, and Essien had a trial at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on April 2000. He played in the club's under-17 team's defeat to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Cliff |last2=Ponting |first2=Ivan |title=Manchester United Official Yearbook 2000 |year=2000 |publisher=Manchester United Books |location=London |isbn=0-233-99783-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/manchesterunited0000unse/page/197 197] |last-author-amp=yes |url=https://archive.org/details/manchesterunited0000unse/page/197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manchester United offered him a contract, but he was ineligible to obtain a work permit in the United Kingdom. He, therefore, considered joining Belgian [[feeder club]] [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]] until he was eligible to move to England. However, his mother meanwhile preferred a move to France instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Hytner |title=Essien makes journey from almost red to deep blue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/21/chelsea.championsleague |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=21 May 2008 |accessdate=10 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Bastia===
In July 2000, Essien was signed by [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] club [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] and made his debut for the club on 30 September 2000 in a league match against [[FC Metz|Metz]], appearing as a substitute for captain Laurent Casanova.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/46035 |title=Bastia v. Metz Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014|date=30 September 2000 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essien did not immediately command a consistent place in the team, being deployed in various positions in the [[Defender (association football)|back four]]. He ultimately finished the [[2000–01 Division 1|2000–01 campaign]] with only 13 league appearances and one goal, which came in the return leg against Metz in a 3–2 defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/45868 |title=Metz v. Bastia Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=7 February 2001 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2001–02 French Division 1|following season]], Essien was given an opportunity by manager [[Robert Nouzaret]] to play in central midfield and flourished in this new role. Essien formed midfield partnerships with [[Nicolas Dieuze]] and [[Cyril Jeunechamp]] and scored vital goals in victories over [[FC Nantes|Nantes]], [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] and [[En Avant de Guingamp|Guingamp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/46520 |title=Nantes v. Bastia Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=18 August 2001 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/46649 |title=Bastia v.

Guingamp Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=19 December 2001 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2002, Essien scored the equalising goal against [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] at the [[Stade Vélodrome]] to even the match at 2–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/46778 |title=Marseille v. Bastia Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=12 January 2002 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also scored a goal in the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] against [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]]. Future [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] teammate [[Didier Drogba]] converted a goal for Le Mans in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/47216 |title=Le Mans v. Bastia Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=1 December 2001 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2002–03 Ligue 1|2002–03 season]], Essien developed into an undisputed starter under new manager [[Gérard Gili]]. However, his tenacious and physical style of play also began to take form as he collected a staggering 12 yellow cards in league play. He opened the new campaign by scoring on his season debut against [[RC Lens|Lens]] in a 1–1 draw and converted five more league goals, which included one in a surprising 2–0 victory over the defending champions [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/47496 |title=Bastia v. Lens Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=3 August 2002 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/47580 |title=Bastia v. Lyon Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=15 January 2003 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the campaign, in which Bastia finished mid-table for the third consecutive season, Essien drew interest from [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], Lyon and Marseille.

===Lyon===
Paris Saint-Germain made Bastia the best offer and it was accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ghana's Essien joins PSG |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/3032604.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 June 2003 |accessdate=5 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Essien rejected PSG's contract offer, instead of agreeing to terms with the two-time defending champions Lyon, who paid Bastia €7.8&amp;nbsp;million for the transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Essien turns down PSG |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/3038262.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=2 July 2003 |accessdate=5 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival, Essien was assigned the number 4 shirt and played as a box-to-box midfielder, which allowed him the freedom to protect and assist [[playmaker]] [[Juninho Pernambucano|Juninho]] while defensive midfielders [[Edmílson]] and [[Mahamadou Diarra]] assisted the defence and directed the distribution. Essien made his club debut in the team's 2003 [[Trophée des champions]] match against [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] on 27 July 2003. In just the fifth minute of play, Essien scored his first goal for the club, and four minutes later, Diarra scored a goal. Lyon won the match 2–1, giving Essien his first club honour as a player.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/tropheeChampions/feuille_match/48871 |title=Lyon v. Auxerre Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=26 July 2003 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In just the third match of the campaign, Essien scored his first league goal for the club in a 3–1 victory over [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48364 |title=Lyon v. Monaco Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=9 August 2003 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; He featured regularly for the rest of the campaign, making 33 more league appearances and scoring two more goals, against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48413 |title=Lyon v. Bordeaux Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014|date=28 January 2004 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48437 |title=Lyon v. Rennes Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=24 April 2004 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 May 2004, Lyon sealed their third consecutive league title by defeating [[Lille OSC|Lille]] 3–0 at the [[Stade Gerland]]. Essien appeared as a substitute in the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/48350 |title=Lyon v. Lille Match Report |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=23 May 2004 |work=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |language=French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UEFA Champions League]], Essien appeared in eight of the ten matches Lyon contested and the club was ultimately eliminated by eventual champions, [[FC Porto|Porto]].

In his [[2004–05 Ligue 1|final season]] at Lyon, Essien appeared in all but one league match as Lyon were crowned champions for the fourth straight season. The match he missed was as a result of a [[Penalty card|red card]] endured in the previous league match. Essien also scored three goals and collected 11 yellow cards, tied for second-worst in the league. His performances in the league resulted in him being voted the [[Trophées UNFP du football#Player of the Year|2005 Player of the Year]] by France's [[National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Essien wins French award |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/4572787.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 May 2005 |accessdate=5 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essien also helped Lyon to reach the quarter-finals of the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League]] where he put in dynamic performances and scored five goals in the tournament. Lyon was eventually eliminated from the tournament in a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] against [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]]. At the end of the season, he was named [[Trophées UNFP du football|Ligue 1 Player of the Year]]. His honour started a record streak of UNFP Player of the Year awards for Lyon players, with the streak coming to an end in 2008 following [[Karim Benzema]]'s victory. He was also nominated for the [[2005 FIFA World Player of the Year]] Award. He placed 22nd in [[2005 FIFA World Player of the Year|2005]]. His acclaim drew attention from Chelsea which he eventually signed for.

===Chelsea===
[[File:MEssienChelsea06.png|thumb|left|Essien in 2006]]
On 14 August 2005, Lyon and Chelsea agreed a [[Pound sterling|£]]24.4&amp;nbsp;million fee for Essien, ending one of the longest-running transfer sagas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Bevan |title=Essien saga nears completion |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4152512.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=15 August 2005 |accessdate=24 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the fee made Essien Chelsea's most expensive signing of all-time, surpassing the £24&amp;nbsp;million Chelsea paid for Didier Drogba the previous summer. The transfer went through on 19 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/4165004.stm |title=Chelsea delight at Essien signing |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=19 August 2005 |accessdate=5 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer came under scrutiny in the [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football#Stevens report|Stevens inquiry]] report, which expressed concerns because of the lack of co-operation from agents [[Pini Zahavi]] and [[Barry Silkman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Stevens said about each club |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=A1YourView&amp;xml=/sport/2007/06/16/sfnste116.xml |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |location=London |date=16 June 2007 |accessdate=17 June 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228065435/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS |archivedate=28 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jun/15/newsstory.boltonwanderers|title=Stevens names and shames 17 transfers in bungs inquiry|first=James|last=Dart|newspaper=Guardian|date=15 June 2007|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essien made his debut as a second-half [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on 21 August 2005, wearing the number 5 on his shirt. The match ended in a 1–0 victory to Chelsea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea 1–0 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4148530.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=21 August 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made an assist in his full debut against [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], and he replaced the injured [[Claude Makélélé]] in the [[Midfielder#Defensive|defensive midfield]] role against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the 2–0 win on 10 September 2005. He soon cemented his place in [[José Mourinho]]'s side, starting in 31 domestic league matches, as well as 11 appearances in other cup competitions.

On 15 December 2005, Essien was handed a two-match ban by [[UEFA]] for a controversial tackle on [[Dietmar Hamann]], which resulted in his [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] from Chelsea's Champions League second round tie with eventual European champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=351543&amp;cc=5901 |title=UEFA charge Essien |accessdate=8 December 2005 |date=8 December 2005 |work=ESPN Soccernet |publisher=ESPN |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021090239/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=351543&amp;cc=5901 |archivedate=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essien apologised to Hamann for the challenge, stating that while he desires to be perceived as a player who &quot;unsettles&quot; opponents, he was not a malicious or an unsporting player; Hamann publicly accepted Essien's apology. In January 2006, Essien was himself stretchered off the field after a challenge from [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] [[captain (association football)|captain]] [[Nigel Reo-Coker]], and was sidelined for three weeks.

[[File:Essien.jpg|thumb|right|215px|Essien warming up before a game in 2008]]

Essien scored his first goal for Chelsea from a low cross from [[Shaun Wright-Phillips]] on 11 March 2006, in a 2–1 victory over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea 2–1 Tottenham |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/4773696.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=25 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His second goal came on 17 April 2006, against [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] with a powerful strike after an assertive burst through the defensive line. Essien ended his maiden season in England with two goals, both in the [[Premier League]].

Essien was nominated for the [[2006 FIFA World Player of the Year]] Award on 12 October 2006, where he placed 22nd. One week later, he was nominated for the 2006 [[Ballon d'Or]]. He was voted as the third Best [[African Footballer of the Year]] in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/soccer/artikel.php?ID=120094 |publisher=GhanaWeb.com |title=How they voted for the Africa best player in 2006 |accessdate=21 January 2013 |date=1 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feat he also achieved in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Caf names trio on award shortlist |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/6221443.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=31 December 2006 |accessdate=6 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He won the 2006 BBC African footballer of the year award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Essien wins BBC African Footballer 2006 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/01_january/05/essien.shtml |work=BBC World Service |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=5 January 2007 |accessdate=5 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following season, Essien scored several important goals, including his first Champions League goal for Chelsea in a 2–0 victory over [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] on 12 September 2006. Later in the competition, Essien scored a late winner in the quarter-final second leg against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] at the [[Mestalla Stadium]] to send Chelsea through to the semifinals with a 2–1 victory on the night and a 3–2 win on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |title=Valencia 1–2 Chelsea (agg 2–3) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/6534987.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=11 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his first match back in the team after several weeks out with a knee injury. Essien also scored a stunning late equaliser at home against Arsenal on 10 December 2006, as the match was going to end Chelsea's long unbeaten run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Sinnott |title=Chelsea 1–1 Arsenal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/6201520.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 December 2006 |accessdate=25 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 May 2007, Chelsea fans voted Essien as Chelsea [[Chelsea F.C.#Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] for his contributions in the 2006–07 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1025826 |title=NIGHT OF SURPRISES FOR PLAYER OF THE YEAR |accessdate=25 June 2014 |date=15 May 2007 |work=Chelsea FC |publisher=Chelseafc.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910105334/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/1025826 |archivedate=10 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first African to receive the honour. His late dramatic equalising goal against Arsenal was also voted as Chelsea Goal of the Season for 2006–07.

On 12 August 2007, Essien scored the winner with his first goal of the [[2007–08 Premier League]] campaign, as Chelsea defeated [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] to set an English record for unbeaten league matches at home, eclipsing [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]'s previous top-flight record of 63 sets between 1978 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Essien seals win for Chelsea over battling Birmingham |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2147363,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=12 August 2007 |accessdate=12 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 2007, Essien was nominated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/classic/awards/fwpg07-shortlistmene%5f22664.pdf |title=2007 FIFA World Player of the Year Men's Shortlist |accessdate=10 October 2007 |date=10 October 2007 |work=FIFA |publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the prestigious [[2007 FIFA World Player of the Year]] Award for the third consecutive year and on 21 October 2007, he was also [https://web.archive.org/web/20090103201422/http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/211007_BALLONDOR2007.html nominated] for the 2007 [[Ballon d'Or]] Award for the third consecutive year. He was voted 15th Best Player in the World at the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year Awards. On 12 December 2007, he was nominated for the 2007 [[African Footballer of the Year]], the third consecutive time he had been nominated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Oluwashina |last=Okeleji |title=Essien makes 2007 CAF shortlist |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7140654.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=12 December 2007 |accessdate=12 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was runner-up to that year's winner, [[Frédéric Kanouté]].

On 22 July 2008, Essien signed a new five-year deal with Chelsea, keeping him at the club until 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3851046,00.html |title=Essien pens new Blues deal |publisher=Skysports.com |date=22 July 2008 |accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also extended his contract on 12 March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/995535 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907114400/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/995535 |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 September 2013 |title=FIVE MORE YEARS FOR ESSIEN |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=25 June 2014 |publisher=Chelsea FC |work=chelseafc.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michael Essien 4633.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Essien in action for Chelsea in 2010]]

It was feared Essien would miss the [[2008–09 Premier League]] season after sustaining [[anterior cruciate ligament]] damage on 5 September while playing for Ghana. However, on 7 March 2009, he came on as a substitute in the second half of the [[2008–09 FA Cup|FA Cup]] match against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. In his second match back from the knee injury, Essien scored just before half-time to give Chelsea a vital [[away goals rule|away goal]] against [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the Champions League first knockout round. Chelsea went on the draw the match 2–2 and through to the quarter-finals 3–2 on aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Stevenson |title=Juventus 2–2 Chelsea (agg 2–3) |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7899606.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his first league start from injury against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], scoring the only goal in the match.

On 6 May 2009, Essien scored a stunning left-footed volley in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal against Barcelona, a tie that Chelsea ultimately lost due to the away goal rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8010840.stm|title=Chelsea 1-1 Barcelona (agg 1-1)|date=6 May 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was later voted as Chelsea's Goal of the Season by the club's fans.

In the [[2009–10 Premier League]] season, Essien put in an excellent performance against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on 24 October 2009 and scored his first goal of the season with a swerving 35-yard shot on 52 minutes in a 5–0 victory at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]]. He scored his first brace for Chelsea against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] with a header and a low shot from outside the box and came close to completing his first hat-trick for the club with a flurry of second-half shots, one of which was tipped onto the bar by Wolves goalkeeper [[Wayne Hennessey]]. Essien was injured on international duty during the [[2010 African Nations Cup]] and missed the remainder of the English domestic season. On 4 June 2010, he signed a two-year extension to his existing contract which would have kept him at the club until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Essien ponders missing World Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chelsea/8633474.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=12 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essien returned to action on 17 July 2010 in a friendly against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and scored the only goal of the match to give Chelsea the win.

After missing the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] through injury, Essien had a bright start to the season for Chelsea. He scored the only goal in a pre-season friendly win against Crystal Palace and was an ever-present in Chelsea's unbeaten month of August. He scored a brace against West Ham United and he scored against [[MŠK Žilina]] in the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]]. Essien also put in impressive performances against Marseille, Blackburn Rovers and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], the latter a match in which he scored the only goal and received a red card. However, Essien would again incur an injury and missed two months of the season, during which Chelsea won just one out of nine matches. He returned to score in the penalty shoot-out loss in the [[2010–11 FA Cup|FA Cup]] against Everton but ultimately had a poor second half of the season. After Chelsea's final match, the [[Ghana Football Association]] announced Essien had returned to the international squad.

In pre-season training for the [[2011–12 Premier League]] season, Essien ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus, undergoing surgery on 11 July 2011. His recovery was said to take up to six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien out for six months |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/14087070.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=11 July 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he began training lightly in late November 2011 and made his comeback on 9 January 2012, playing 75 minutes of the reserves' 3–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Essien makes reserves appearance |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1006592/michael-essien-makes-return-for-chelsea-reserves?cc=5901 |work=ESPN |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=9 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his 150th Premier League appearance for Chelsea as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chelsea vs Sunderland |url=http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/318268/gamecast.html |work=ESPN |date=14 January 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112083317/http://www.espnfc.com/gamecast/318268/gamecast.html |archivedate=12 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/4375/editorials/2014/01/29/4579077/chronicling-michael-essiens-chelsea-career|title=Chronicling Michael Essien's Chelsea career|first=Sammie|last=Frimpong|publisher=goal.com|date=29 January 2014|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 2012, Essien featured as late substitute in Chelsea's 0–0 draw with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] at [[Carrow Road]].

Due to missing most of the beginning half of the [[2011–12 Premier League]] season, Essien was unable to gain favour with manager [[André Villas-Boas]]. On 21 February 2012, during a [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] match against [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], Villas-Boas left [[Frank Lampard]], Essien and [[Ashley Cole]] on the substitutes' bench. Chelsea lost 3–1 and the club's technical director asked for an explanation of the team selection on behalf of Chelsea owner [[Roman Abramovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/mar/04/andre-villas-boas-chelsea |title=Five moments when André Villas-Boas's luck turned against him |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=4 March 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |date=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2012, following a 1–0 league defeat against West Brom which left Chelsea three points adrift of Arsenal in the battle for fourth place in the [[2011–12 Premier League|Premier League]], Villas-Boas' employment was terminated by Chelsea, with assistant manager [[Roberto Di Matteo]] being appointed as caretaker manager on an interim basis until the end of the season. Di Matteo immediately showed favour towards veteran Chelsea players like Essien, Lampard and [[John Terry]]. Subsequently, Essien started in Chelsea's second leg champions league fixture against Napoli, with Chelsea winning 4–1 – and 5–4 on aggregate – in an entertaining match allowing Chelsea to advance to the quarter-final, where they met [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. Essien subsequently remained an unused substitute in Chelsea's Champions League run, culminating in ''the Blues''' victory over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[2012 UEFA Champions League Final|final]], making Chelsea the first [[London]]-based club to win the title.

===Real Madrid (loan)===
On 31 August 2012, Essien signed a season-long loan deal with [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], reuniting him with his former manager at Chelsea, José Mourinho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Essien Loaned to Real Madrid |url=http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2906850/title/essien-loaned-to-real-madrid |work=chelseafc.com |publisher=Chelsea FC |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=31 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902175405/http://www.chelseafc.com/news-article/article/2906850/title/essien-loaned-to-real-madrid |archivedate=2 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At his introductory press conference with Real Madrid, Mourinho affectionally referred to Essien as &quot;his son&quot; while Essien referred to Mourinho as his &quot;Daddy&quot;. On 3 November, Essien scored his first goal for Real Madrid. During the last match of the season – and Essien's last game as a Madrid player – Essien scored his second goal for Madrid, which he dedicated to Mourinho.

===Milan===
Essien signed for Italian club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] on a one-and-a-half-year contract on 27 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Essien: Chelsea midfielder secures AC Milan move |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25914346 |work=BBC Sport |date=27 January 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Panathinaikos===
On 2 June 2015, Essien signed a two-year contract with Greek club [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Essien completes signing for Panathinaikos |url=http://www.espnfc.com/panathinaikos/story/2476941/michael-essien-completes-signing-for-panathinaikos |website=ESPN FC |publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures |date=2 June 2015 |accessdate=2 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal made him the club's highest-paid player, with an annual salary of €800,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;release&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Isaac |last=Darko |title=Michael Essien: Ghana midfielder released by Panathinaikos |url=http://pulse.com.gh/sports/michael-essien-ghana-midfielder-released-by-panathinaikos-id5208048.html |website=Pulse.com.gh |date=29 June 2016 |accessdate=29 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the first three months of the season recovering from a leg injury. He was due to make his debut on 21 November 2015 against Panathinaikos' archrivals [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], but the match was cancelled. He played his first match one week later. On 24 January 2016, he scored his first goal for Panathinaikos in a 2–0 away league win over [[Levadiakos F.C.|Levadiakos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yen.com.gh/35419-watch-michael-essiens-first-goal-panathinaikos.html|title=Watch Michael Essien's First Goal For Panathinaikos|first=K.|last=Effah}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a season in Greece, Essien was omitted from Panathinaikos' squad for the [[2016–17 Panathinaikos F.C. season|2016–17 season]], with the expectation he would be released from his contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;release&quot;/&gt; His termination by the club was confirmed almost three months later after the two parties reached a mutual agreement over his release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Breaking News: Former Chelsea star Michael Essien finally terminates Panathinaikos contract |url=http://ghanasoccernet.com/breaking-news-former-chelsea-star-michael-essien-finally-terminates-panathinaikos-contract |website=GHANAsoccernet.com |date=20 September 2016 |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the agreement was reached and Essien was released from his contract, the club failed to remit the money owed to him and Essien appealed to the competent court for football affairs in Greece, which ordered Panathinaikos to pay him the outstanding sum of about €36,000 or face the deduction of three points in the coming 2018/19 competition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.efsyn.gr/arthro/panathinaikos-afairesi-trion-vathmon-logo-esien Παναθηναϊκός: Αφαίρεση τριών βαθμών λόγω Εσιέν!]&quot; (&quot;Panathinaikos: deduction of three points on account of Essien!&quot;) by Kostas Manolioudakis, ''Efimerida Syntakton'', 8 May 2018 (in [[Greek language|Greek]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Persib Bandung===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MichaelEssienPersib.jpg|thumb|right|Essien joins Persib in 2017]] --&gt;
Essien rejected an offer from Australian [[A-League]] club [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]] in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indonesia-investments.com/news/todays-headlines/football-news-michael-essien-joins-indonesia-s-persib-bandung/item7680?|title=Football News: Michael Essien Joins Indonesia's Persib Bandung - Indonesia Investments|website=Indonesia-Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2017, Essien joined the Indonesian club side [[Persib Bandung]], signing a one-year contract with an option to extend for an additional year. He took the number 5 shirt for the [[2017 Liga 1]] season, the same number he wore during his nine years at Chelsea. Speaking about his move to Indonesia, Essien told the club's official website, &quot;I hope I am the prelude to other world players moving to Indonesia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former Chelsea and Real Madrid midfielder Michael Essien has joined Indonesian side Persib Bandung on a one-year deal|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10801409/former-chelsea-midfielder-michael-essien-joins-indonesian-side-persib-bandung|website=Sky Sports|date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=14 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Essien Pakai Nomor 5 di Persib Bandung|url=http://m.cnnindonesia.com/olahraga/20170314102808-142-199942/michael-essien-pakai-nomor-5-di-persib-bandung/|website=CNN Indonesia|language=Indonesian|date=14 March 2017 |accessdate=14 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April, he scored his first goal from the header in a 2–2 draw over [[PS TNI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://global.espn.com/football/blog/football-asia/153/post/3110290/michael-essien-scores-first-indonesian-goal-but-persib-bandung-draw-again?src=com|title=Michael Essien scores first Indonesian goal but Persib Bandung draw again|website=ESPN|date=23 April 2017|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 2018, Persib's club chief executive, Zainuri Hasyim said that Persib has now released Essien because the club already filling their maximum quota of four foreign players based on the [[Football Association of Indonesia|PSSI]]'s regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/06/07/ex-chelsea-player-michael-essien-released-by-indonesias-persib-bandung.html|title=Ex-Chelsea player Michael Essien released by Indonesia's Persib Bandung|agency=AFP|date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sabail===
On 16 March 2019, Essien signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with [[Sabail FK]] of the [[Azerbaijan Premier League]], which will also see him coach their U19 team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Essien&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=MAYKL ESYEN &quot;SƏBAİL&quot;DƏ! |url=https://sabailfc.az/az/2019/03/16/maykl-esyen-s%C9%99baild%C9%99/ |website=sabailfc.az |publisher=Sabail FK |accessdate=16 March 2019 |language=Azerbaijani |date=16 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47582875|title=Michael Essien: Former Ghana and Chelsea midfielder moves to Azerbaijan|first=Oluwashina|last=Okeleji|website=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=16 March 2019|accessdate=27 August 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Essien's international career started with the [[Ghana national under-17 football team|Ghana under-17 national team]], the ''Black Starlets'' when he played in the [[1999 FIFA U-17 World Championship]] in New Zealand and won the bronze medal. In 2001, despite being one of the youngest players in the tournament, Essien participated in the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship]] with the ''Black Satellites'' in Argentina, where the nation finished runners-up to Argentina. His exceptional performances captured the attention of many and was widely tipped to be one of Africa's next rising stars.

Essien made his competitive [[Ghana national football team|senior debut]] in the [[2002 Africa Cup of Nations]] against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] on 21 January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/02a-det.html |title=African Nations Cup 2002 – Final Tournament Details |accessdate=6 April 2007 |first=Sébastien |last=Duret |work=Football statistics website |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had played for Ghana in a pre-tournament friendly against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] on 4 January 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/intldetails/2002af.html |title=International Matches 2002 – Africa |accessdate=21 January 2013 |first=Barrie |last=Courtney |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2006, Essien was selected to be part of the team that represented Ghana at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany. He played in midfield with team captain [[Stephen Appiah]] and [[Sulley Muntari]]. Essien played in Ghana's 0–2 defeat to [[Italy national football team|Italy]], their 2–0 victory over the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], and the 2–1 victory over the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], and helped Ghana become the only African team to reach the second-round of the 2006 World Cup. However, he was suspended for Ghana's second round match against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and could only watch as Ghana lost 0–3. Upon the team's return to Ghana, Essien said the team had gained invaluable experience and would be aiming to make the next finals, held in Africa for the first time in the tournament's history at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].

In the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]], Essien turned in another strong performance, driving the team to the semifinals with his power-packed performances. In the quarter-final against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], when team captain [[John Mensah]] was dismissed on the stroke of the hour for a professional foul on Nigeria's [[Peter Odemwingie]], Essien assumed the captaincy for the remainder of the match as Ghana eventually won 2–1. He was voted as an All-Star Player during the tournament. The Team of the Tournament was decided by the Technical Study Group (TSG) after careful observations of all the tournament's matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CAF names Best XI for Ghana 2008 ACN |url=http://cafonline.com/?lng=1&amp;cmpt=0&amp;module=media&amp;ANC=&amp;TNews=1&amp;idrub=96400&amp;idnews=82850-777432.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116062321/http://cafonline.com/?lng=1&amp;cmpt=0&amp;module=media&amp;ANC=&amp;TNews=1&amp;idrub=96400&amp;idnews=82850-777432.html |archivedate=16 January 2009 |work=Cafonline.com |publisher=Confederation of African Football |date=10 February 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an international match played against [[Libya national football team|Libya]] on 5 September 2008, Essien ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament playing for Ghana in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF)|World Cup qualification stage]] and was out of action for six months, missing the majority of the 2008–09 season, before returning on 4 March to play for Chelsea Reserves against Aston Villa Reserves. He scored the last goal in the 4–3 loss. He still managed to take part in 10 of Ghana's 11 qualification matches, amassing more than 800 minutes of game time as Ghana finished at the top of their group to seal qualification to the 2010 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1099218.html#essien%20what%20fantastic%20feeling|title=Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was announced on 27 May 2010 that Essien would miss the World Cup after he was told he would not fully recover from his knee injury until the end of July, more than two weeks after the tournament was to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8709466.stm|title=Ghana's Michael Essien is ruled out of the World Cup|date=27 May 2010|work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, Essien has announced that he will be standing down from the Ghana national side for the near future to focus on his career with Chelsea, having suffered two significant injuries while playing for Ghana in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report-michael-essien-puts-international-career-with-ghana-on-hold-1433228|title=Essien puts international career with Ghana on hold |date=3 September 2010|work=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having recovered from those injuries, Essien subsequently promised his availability to his nation &quot;very soon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ibrahim |last=Sannie |title=Essien announces Ghana comeback |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/9479947.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 May 2011 |accessdate=12 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Essien has announced his retirement from international football, after over 12 years of active service with Ghana. He said that he even retired before the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] but he was called back by former Ghana coach, [[James Kwesi Appiah]] to come and help the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.goal.com/en-gh/news/michael-essien-announces-retirement-from-international/v1i06vligxyi139ar7ye6z25w|title=Michael Essien announces retirement from international football|date=29 July 2018|accessdate=20 August 2019|work=Goal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coaching career==
===FC Nordsjælland===
On 19 August 2020 it was revealed, that Essien was training with [[Danish Superliga]] club [[FC Nordsjælland]] where he also got the opportunity to be part of the work around the Superliga team and several of the club's academy teams, just as he got a better knowledge of the teaching and development of young people off the field in FCN, as inspiration for his ongoing coaching education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/michael-essien-suger-til-sig-hos-fcn/ Michael Essien suger til sig hos FCN], bold.dk, 19 August 2020&lt;/ref&gt; Nordsjælland is in partnership with [[Right to Dream Academy]] in Ghana, which was why Essien found the project interesting.

However, the club confirmed on 9 September 2020, that they had affiliated with Essien as part of the club's coaching team for the 2020-2021 season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fcn.dk/2020/09/michael-essien-bliver-en-del-af-fcns-traenerteam/ MICHAEL ESSIEN BLIVER EN DEL AF FCN’S TRÆNERTEAM], fcn.dk, 9 September 2020&lt;/ref&gt; He got the title Player Coach. Essien would thus be part of the coaching team in an assistant role at the same time, he would participate in the training sessions to implement the exercises in the best possible way and be able to contribute with new input to the coaching team's evaluations.

==Style of play==
Essien is a physically strong [[midfielder]], who often plays in a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfield]] role.&lt;ref name=&quot;gladiatore&quot;/&gt; He has often been touted as a [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box midfielder]] for his ability to exert energy in supporting both [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|offensive]] and [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive]] play, and for his powerful and tough tackling playing style, which has earned him the nickname &quot;The Bison&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;chelseafc.com&quot;&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101202014209/http://www.chelseafc.com/page/PlayerProfileDetail/0%2C%2C10268~27901%2C00.html &quot;Michael Essien&quot;]. ''Chelseafc.com''. Retrieved 21 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Essien can also play as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]], both on the [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right]] of defence and in the [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre]]. In addition to his work-rate, physicality, and defensive skills, Essien also possesses good technique, vision, tactical intelligence, and leadership qualities,&lt;ref name=&quot;gladiatore&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://direttanews.gazzetta.it/Article/330370-Essien-il-gladiatore-dai-piedi-di-velluto?refresh_ce |title=Essien, il gladiatore dai piedi di velluto |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=Italian |date=24 January 2014 |accessdate=10 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a powerful striker of the ball from distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/oliver-haydock/six-stars-for-africas-wor_b_582502.html |title=Six Stars for Africa's World Cup |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |author1=Oliver Haydock |date=20 May 2010 |accessdate=10 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lampard started the [[2009–10 Chelsea F.C. season|2009–10 season]] by scoring against Manchester United, in the [[2009 FA Community Shield|2009 Community Shield]], in the 72nd minute. The match ended 2–2, and Lampard scored in its penalty shootout which they won 4–1. He scored his 133rd goal for Chelsea in a Champions League match against [[Atlético Madrid]] on 21 October 2009, which moved him up to fifth among the club's all-time goalscorers. He had been struggling to score the number of goals he had in the past seasons, however this soon changed as he scored two goals in the 5–0 defeat of Blackburn on 24 October 2009. On 30 October, he was nominated for the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award for the sixth-straight year.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

On 16 December, Lampard scored a crucial 79th minute winning goal against [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and on 20 December, Lampard scored a penalty against his former club West Ham in a 1–1 draw, however he had to take his spot-kick three times due to players running into the box too early, he nonetheless scored all three. In Chelsea's 7–2 thrashing of Sunderland in January 2010, Lampard scored twice to add to his league tally. On 27 January 2010, Lampard again scored two goals, in Chelsea's 3–0 win over [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the [[2009–10 Premier League|Premier League]]. On 27 February, Lampard yet again scored twice against Manchester City but despite his contribution Chelsea went on to lose the game 4–2 at home, for the first time in 38 games.

Lampard, for the second time in his career, hit four goals in one match against Aston Villa on 27 March 2010 to bring his goal tally past 20, for the fifth-consecutive season. This also brought him his 151st Chelsea goal, and it put him as the club's third highest scorer ever, overtaking [[Peter Osgood]]'s record of 150. Lampard scored in a 3–0 win, again over Aston Villa, in the 2010 FA Cup semi-final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8587517.stm|title=Chelsea 7 – 1 Aston Villa|date=27 March 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=28 March 2010|first=Phil|last=McNulty|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216115834/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8587517.stm|archive-date=16 February 2010|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lampard reached 20 Premier League goals for the first time when he scored twice against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in Chelsea's 7–0 win on 25 April 2010.

On 2 May, Lampard scored against Liverpool in the second last game of the season to give Chelsea a vital three points that took them to the top of the league by a single point. He scored one and assisted two other goals in the final match of the season where Chelsea thrashed Wigan Athletic 8–0 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]] to win the 2009–10 Premier League title and give him a remarkable 27 goals in the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8663686.stm|title=Chelsea 8 – 0 Wigan|date=9 May 2010|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=9 May 2010|first=Phil|last=McNulty|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714160702/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8663686.stm|archive-date=14 July 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2010–11 Chelsea F.C. season|2010–11 season]] began brightly for Lampard, being an integral part of Chelsea's system as usual. After a match against Stoke in August 2010, which Chelsea won 2–0, it was revealed that Lampard was suffering from a [[hernia]], which was successfully operated on. However, he suffered fresh injuries during training in mid-November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/12/chelsea-frank-lampard-muscle-injury |title=Chelsea's Frank Lampard out for 'two to three weeks' with new injury |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Martin |last=Pengelly |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=8 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508151706/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/12/chelsea-frank-lampard-muscle-injury |archive-date=8 May 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained sidelined for a further three weeks.

On 9 January, Lampard scored twice and gave one assist in a 7–0 win against Ipswich Town in the FA Cup reaching the landmark of 201 career club goals.

Lampard then assisted for [[Nicolas Anelka]] in Chelsea's 2–0 victory against [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]], in the Round of 16 match in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].

On 24 April 2009, Lampard was involved in a radio confrontation with [[James O'Brien (radio presenter)|James O'Brien]] on the London radio station [[LBC 97.3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/lampard-vents-anger-at-heartless-comments-live-on-radio-1673790.html | title=Lampard vents anger at 'heartless' comments live on radio | newspaper=The Independent | date=24 April 2009 | accessdate=25 April 2009 | location=London | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426033402/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/lampard-vents-anger-at-heartless-comments-live-on-radio-1673790.html | archive-date=26 April 2009 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers had reported that following Lampard's split from Rivas their children were living with her in a small flat while Lampard had converted their family home into a [[bachelor pad]]. Lampard phoned in, objecting to criticism and asserting that he had fought &quot;tooth and nail&quot; to keep his family together.&lt;ref name=&quot;transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/frank-lampards-call-to-lbc-the-full-transcript-1673885.html | title=Frank Lampard's call to LBC: The full transcript | newspaper=The Independent | date=24 April 2009 | accessdate=25 April 2009 | location=London | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426033302/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/frank-lampards-call-to-lbc-the-full-transcript-1673885.html | archive-date=26 April 2009 | url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;
