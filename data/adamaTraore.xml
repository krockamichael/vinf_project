On 14 August 2015, Traoré joined [[Premier League]] club [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on a five-year deal for a reported £7 million (€10 million) that could rise to €12 million, with Barcelona inserting a three-year buy-back clause in his contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33914082|title=Adama Traore: Barcelona winger joins Aston Villa|website=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 August 2015|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut eight days later against [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], and his cross led to an [[own goal]] from [[Pape Souaré]] eight minutes after he had entered the game as a substitute for [[Carlos Sánchez (Colombian footballer)|Carlos Sánchez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33944695|title=Crystal Palace 2–1 Aston Villa|website=BBC Sport|last=Emons|first=Michael|date=22 August 2015|accessdate=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal three days later, the team's first of a 5–3 home win over [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in [[2015–16 Football League Cup|the second round]] in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33969962|title=Aston Villa 5–3 Notts County|website=BBC Sport|date=25 August 2015|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traoré came on as a second-half substitute for the last-placed Villans away to relegation rivals [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 2 January 2016, and via a counter-attack he [[Assist (association football)|assisted]] compatriot [[Carles Gil]]'s aerial volley equaliser – he was later replaced himself through injury, as his team lost 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/sunderland-afc/latest-safc-news/safc-match-analysis/sunderland-3-aston-villa-1-jermain-defoe-double-secures-priceless-win-1-7653067|title=Sunderland 3 Aston Villa 1: Jermain Defoe double secures priceless win|newspaper=[[Sunderland Echo]]|last=Young|first=Chris|date=2 January 2016|accessdate=3 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103182255/http://www.sunderlandecho.com/sport/sunderland-afc/latest-safc-news/safc-match-analysis/sunderland-3-aston-villa-1-jermain-defoe-double-secures-priceless-win-1-7653067|archive-date=3 January 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following that game, he was dropped from the team due to indiscipline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adama-traore-start-aston-villa-11160339|title=Will Adama Traore start for Aston Villa?

===Middlesbrough===
On 31 August 2016, Traoré signed a four-year contract with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] for an undisclosed fee and [[Albert Adomah]] moved in the opposite direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfc.co.uk/news/article/2016/middlesbrough-fc-adama-traore-aston-villa-deadline-day-3283945.aspx|title=Deadline day: Aston Villa’s Adama Traore joins Boro|publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.|date=31 August 2016|access-date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut on 10 September 2016 in a 1–2 home loss to [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], replacing [[Cristhian Stuani]] for the final nine minutes;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/karanka-adama-traore-i-never-11870885|title=Karanka on Adama Traore: 'I never bring a player in just to be on the bench'|newspaper=[[Teesside Gazette]]|location=Middlesbrough|last=Tallentire|first=Philip|date=12 September 2016|accessdate=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; during [[2016–17 Premier League|his first season]], he took part in 31 matches without scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-ready-make-shock-move-10657456|title=Chelsea ready to make a shock move for Middlesbrough winger Adama Traore|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|location=London|last=Lewis|first=Darren|date=20 June 2017|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traoré impressed during [[2017–18 EFL Championship|2017–18]], first under [[Garry Monk]] and then [[Tony Pulis]], with his pace causing several problems for opposition defenders, including an impressive performance against [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 2 March 2018 in a 3–0 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/middlesbrough-3-leeds-united-0-wiedwald-faces-wrath-of-whites-fans-after-riverside-defeat-1-9045887|title=Middlesbrough 3 Leeds United 0: Wiedwald faces wrath of Whites fans after Riverside defeat|newspaper=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|location=Leeds|last=Urquhart|first=Joe|date=2 March 2018|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He totalled five goals and ten assists during the campaign as his team reached [[EFL Championship play-offs|the play-offs]] in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/08/08/sports/soccer/08reuters-soccer-england-wlv-traore.html|title=Wolves complete signing of winger Traore|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=8 August 2018|accessdate=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they were [[2018 English Football League play-offs|knocked out]] by his former side Aston Villa;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44035613|title=Aston Villa 0–0 Middlesbrough|website=BBC Sport|last=Scott|first=Ged|date=15 May 2018|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, he won Middlesbrough's Fans' Player of the Year, Young Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards.&lt;ref name=Awards&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/middlesbroughs-award-winner-adama-traore-14624962|title=Middlesbrough's award winner Adama Traore is linked with big money move in the summer|newspaper=Teesside Gazette|location=Middlesbrough|last=Tallentire|first=Philip|date=7 May 2018|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 October 2019, in his 50th competitive appearance for Wolves, Traoré scored both goals in a 2–0 away victory against reigning champions [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49868094|title=Man City 0–2 Wolves: Champions beaten at home|website=BBC Sport|last=Stone|first=Simon|date=6 October 2019|accessdate=6 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal in UEFA European club football as Wolves drew 3–3 away to [[S.C.

==International career==
On 17 February 2014, the [[Malian Football Federation]] reported that Traoré and his older brother [[Moha Traoré|Mohamed]] had decided to represent [[Mali national football team|Mali]] at senior level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supersport.com/football/africa/news/140217/Barcas_Adama_Traore_to_play_for_Mali|title=Barca’s Adama Traore to play for Mali|website=SuperSport|publisher=[[MultiChoice]]|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=18 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in an interview with BBC Sport in October 2015, the former stated that he was still considering his international options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/34436576|title=Aston Villa's Traore in no rush to decide international future|website=BBC Sport|last=Okeleji|first=Oluwashina|date=4 October 2015|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his debut for the [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spanish under-21s]] on 22 March 2018, playing 15 minutes in the 5–3 away win over [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|Northern Ireland]] for the [[2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2019 UEFA European Championship]] [[2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification|qualifiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mfc.co.uk/news/international-round-up-traore-makes-international-bow|title=International round-Up: Traore makes international bow|publisher=Middlesbrough F.C.|date=23 March 2018|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2019, Traoré declared that he wanted to play for Mali. However, days later he received his first call-up to the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]] for [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]] [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying|qualifying matches]] against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] and [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in place of injured [[Rodrigo (footballer, born 1991)|Rodrigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2019/11/10/5dc74c7a268e3e56588b45b1.html|title=Adama Traore called into Spain squad to replace injured Rodrigo|newspaper=Marca|last=Munday|first=Billy|date=10 November 2019|accessdate=10 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He pulled out of the squad himself due to injury, and was replaced by [[Pablo Sarabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50367205|title=Wolves' Adama Traore forced to withdraw from Spain squad|website=BBC Sport|date=11 November 2019|accessdate=11 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2020, he said he had not decided between Spain and Mali after a photograph of him posing with a Mali shirt circulated online, saying &quot;I am grateful (to have the chance) with the two international teams - Spain where I was born and Mali where my origins are.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50981963|title=Wolves' winger Adama Traore yet to decide between Spain and Mali|website=BBC Sport|date=3 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2020, Traoré was again called up ahead of Spain's September [[UEFA Nations League]] matches against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ansu Fati, Adama Traore Called Into New-Look Spain National Team Squad|url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2020/08/20/spain-squad-germany-ukraine-nations-league-luis-enrique-ansu-fati|work=Associated Press|date=20 August 2020|accessdate=21 August 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was removed from the squad after testing positive for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on 31 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=2020-08-31|title=Adama Traore tests positive for COVID-19 and will not join Spain squad|url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2020/09/01/5f4d415a268e3e93108b45a5.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-09-01|website=Marca|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He missed the Germany match as he awaited the result of the second test to determine if the initial result was a [[false positive]]. The second test result was negative and Traore rejoined the squad on 3 September, ahead of the Ukraine match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.expressandstar.com/sport/football/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/2020/09/04/wolves-receive-adama-traore-boost-after-initial-covid-19-scare/ |title= Wolves receive Adama Traore boost after initial Covid-19 scare |first=Joe|last=Edwards|publisher=[[Express &amp; Star]] |date=3 September 2020|accessdate=4 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 September, Traore was once again ordered to leave the camp after an antibodies test came back negative. [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] cited the [[UEFA]] protocol, which recommended that he not travel with the team, even though they did not believe there was any risk of transmitting the virus to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2020/09/04/5f525fcb22601d3a7c8b45f0.html|title=Adama Traore sent home from Spain squad after positive test for coronavirus antibodies|publisher=[[Daily Mirror]] |first=Gareth |last=Bicknell|date=6 September 2020|accessdate=6 September 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2020, Mali named Traoré to their squad for upcoming matches against [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] on 9 October and [[Iran national football team|Iran]] on 13 October in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-mali/mali-call-up-doucoure-and-adama-traore-for-friendly-internationals-idUKKBN26K1JU |title = Mali call up Doucoure and Adama Traore for friendly internationals |publisher=Reuters |date=29 September 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style of play==
[[Tim Sherwood]], Traoré's manager at Villa, compared him to both [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], saying he had &quot;a bit&quot; of both. Catherine Wilson of ''[[ESPN FC]]'' credited his &quot;athleticism&quot;, though also remarked that his &quot;footballing brain and teamwork skills are definitely up for debate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/club/middlesbrough/369/blog/post/3041276/boro-would-miss-traore-tenacity-urgency-if-he-were-sold-to-chelsea|title=Boro would miss Traore's tenacity, urgency if he were sold to Chelsea|website=ESPN FC|last=Wilson|first=Catherine|date=18 January 2017|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarking on his physique, the ''[[Jordan Gale]]'' stated &quot;He's built like an absolute tank. Size of the arms on that man. One drive and it would be lights out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/international/northern-ireland-u21s-35-spain-u21s-irish-league-stars-shine-against-la-liga-talent-despite-harsh-defeat-36732830.html|title=Northern Ireland U21s 3–5 Spain U21s: Irish League stars shine against La Liga talent despite harsh defeat|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|last=Hanna|first=Gareth|date=22 March 2018|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, ESPN's Matt Stanger acknowledged Traoré's pace and strength, and added that he &quot;is now showing the composure to find the killer pass&quot;, while boasting &quot;rapid acceleration&quot; and &quot;excellent close control to shield the ball from defenders&quot;; Stanger also believed Traoré's &quot;defensive contribution&quot; to be developed, pointing his key weaknesses as &quot;moments of recklessness&quot; and &quot;decision-making&quot; which &quot;continues to frustrate his teammates&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3409618/scouting-spotlight-jonathan-tah-adama-traore-andrija-zivkovic|title=Scouting spotlight: Jonathan Tah, Adama Traore, Andrija Zivkovic|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last=Stanger|first=Matt|date=7 March 2018|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also described by ''[[Teesside Gazette]]'''s Philip Tallentire as a 'tallismanic playmaker', after his form during the 2017–18 season.&lt;ref name=Awards/&gt;

While with Wolverhampton Wanderers, after his first three appearances as a substitute, Michael Butler of ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported: &quot;Traoré has always been regarded as a rough diamond, lightning quick but perhaps lacking composure or an end product. [...] Per 90 minutes, nobody in the Premier League has created more chances than the 22-year-old or completed even half the number of successful [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbles]]: [[Eden Hazard]] has 5.56 to Traoré’s 11.87.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

==Personal life==
Traoré's elder brother, [[Moha Traoré|Moha]], is also a footballer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mundodeportivo.com/20140209/mundo-barsa/mali-viene-a-buscar-a-adama_54400070973.html|title=Mali viene a buscar a Adama|trans-title=Mali come to get Adama|newspaper=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|last=Gascón|first=Javier|language=es|date=9 February 2014|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
