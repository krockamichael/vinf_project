'''Futbol Club Barcelona''' ({{IPA-ca|fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə|-|Futbol Club Barcelona - name.ogg}}), commonly referred to as '''Barcelona''' and colloquially known as '''Barça''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈbaɾsə|}}), is a Spanish professional [[Football team|football club]] based in [[Barcelona]].

Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English, and Catalan footballers led by [[Joan Gamper]], the club has become a symbol of Catalan culture and [[Catalanism]], hence the motto ''&quot;Més que un club&quot;'' (''&quot;More than a club&quot;''). Unlike many other football clubs, the [[Supporters of FC Barcelona|supporters]] own and operate Barcelona. It is the fourth-most valuable sports team in the world, worth $4.06&amp;nbsp;billion, and the [[Deloitte Football Money League|world's richest]] football club in terms of revenue, with an annual turnover of €840,8&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2018/06/12/the-worlds-most-valuable-soccer-teams-2018/|title=The World's Most Valuable Soccer Teams|date=12 June 2018|magazine=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/sports-business-group/articles/deloitte-football-money-league.html|title=Deloitte Football Money League 2020|date=30 January 2020|publisher=Deloitte}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Barcelona anthem is the &quot;[[Cant del Barça]]&quot;, written by Jaume Picas and [[Josep Maria Espinàs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/identity/card/the-anthems|title=The history of the Barça anthems|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 74 trophies: 26 [[La Liga]], 30 [[Copa del Rey]], 13 [[Supercopa de España]], 3 [[Copa Eva Duarte]], and 2 [[Copa de la Liga]] trophies, as well as being the record holder for the latter four competitions.

Barcelona is one of three founding members of the [[La Liga|Primera División]] that have [[List of unrelegated association football clubs|never been relegated]] from the top division since its inception in 1929, along with [[Athletic Bilbao]] and Real Madrid.

On 22 October 1899, [[Joan Gamper|Hans Gamper]] placed an advertisement in ''Los Deportes'' declaring his wish to form a football club; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November. Eleven players attended – [[Walter Wild]] (the first director of the club), Lluís d'Ossó, [[Bartomeu Terradas]], Otto Kunzle, Otto Maier, Enric Ducal, Pere Cabot, Carles Pujol, Josep Llobet, John Parsons, and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil p. 89&quot;&gt;Ball, Phil p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vitrina-1.v1311695239.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A formation of FC Barcelona in 1903]]
FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups, competing in the [[Catalan football championship|Campionat de Catalunya]] and the [[Copa del Rey]]. In 1902, the club won its first trophy, the Copa Macaya, and participated in the first Copa del Rey, losing 1–2 to [[Athletic Bilbao|Bizcaya]] in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/spancuphist.html |title=Spain&amp;nbsp;– List of Cup Finals |author=Carnicero, José Vicente Tejedor |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=21 May 2010|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction, finding the club struggling not just on the pitch, but also financially and socially, after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905. He said in a meeting, &quot;Barcelona cannot die and must not die. If there is nobody who is going to try, then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/joan-gamper-1908-1909-1910-1913-1917-1919-1921-1923-1924-1925 |title=Joan Gamper|publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925, he spent 25 years in total at the helm. One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_1.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090702100948/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 July 2009 |title=History part I |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=11 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 1909, the team moved into the [[Camp de la Indústria]], a stadium with a capacity of 8,000. To celebrate their new surroundings, the club conducted a logo contest the following year. [[Carles Comamala]] won the contest, and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day.&lt;ref name=crest&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120530060040/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html |url-status=dead |archive-date= 30 May 2012 |title= The crest |accessdate= 30 July 2010 |publisher= FC Barcelona }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new stadium, Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the [[Pyrenees Cup]], which, at the time, consisted of the best teams of [[Languedoc]], [[Le midi|Midi]] and [[Aquitaine]] (Southern France), the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] and Catalonia; all were former members of the [[Marca Hispanica]] region. The contest was the most prestigious in that era.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Bill. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913, Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times. Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion, managing the side along with Amechazurra and [[Jack Greenwell]]. The latter became the club's first full-time coach in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Closa ''et al.'' p. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona, which local rivals [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]] won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/pyrenees.html |title= Coupe des Pyrenées – Copa de los Pirineos |publisher= Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date= 19 June 2001|accessdate= 12 June 2010|author = Ferrer, Carles Lozano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same period, the club changed its official language from [[Spanish language|Castilian]] to [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, Ramón. p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February 1917, the club held its first [[testimonial match]] to honour [[Ramón Torralba]], who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/ramon-torralba-larraz|title=Ramon Torralba Larraz|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members, and by 1922, the club had more than 20,000, who helped finance a new stadium. The club then moved to the new [[Camp de Les Corts|Les Cortes]], which they inaugurated the same year.&lt;ref name=Arnaud103/&gt; Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000, and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_2.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530060040/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_2.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 May 2012 |title=History part II |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=11 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona's history. After this hiring, the club's fortunes began to improve on the field. During the Gamper-led era, Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya, six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first &quot;golden age&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona1&quot;/&gt;

===1923–1957: Rivera, Republic and Civil War===
[[File:Barcelona bombing (1938).jpg|thumb|left|250px|alt=Black-and-white photo of the city from high above. Smoke from a bomb can be seen|The aerial bombardment of Barcelona in 1938]]
On 14 June 1925, in a spontaneous reaction against [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship, the crowd in the stadium jeered the [[Royal March]]. As a reprisal, the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/joan-gamper-1908-1909-1910-1913-1917-1919-1921-1923-1924-1925|title=Joan Gamper (1908–1909 / / 1910–1913 / / 1917–1919 / / 1921–1923 / / 1924–1925)|publisher=FC Barcelona|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coincided with the transition to professional football, and, in 1926, the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed, for the first time, to operate a professional football club.&lt;ref name=Arnaud103&gt;Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1927, the club held a second testimonial match for [[Paulino Alcántara]], against the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]]. To kick off the match, local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona.cat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/downloads/centre_de_documentacio/annexes/castellano/24_._PARTIDOS_DE_HOMENAJE_A_JUGADORES.pdf |title=Partidos de Homenaje a Jugadores |language=Catalan |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=24 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616045544/http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/downloads/centre_de_documentacio/annexes/castellano/24_._PARTIDOS_DE_HOMENAJE_A_JUGADORES.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2012 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled &quot;Oda a [[Franz Platko|Platko]]&quot;, which was written by a member of the [[Generation of '27]], [[Rafael Alberti]], inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], Franz Platko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football, European Integration, National Identity: The Case of FC Barcelona|author=Roy, Joaquín|year=2001|url=http://aei.pitt.edu/2175/|publisher=European Community Studies Association (paper)|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 June 1929, Barcelona won the [[1929 La Liga|inaugural Spanish League]]. A year after winning the championship, on 30 July 1930, Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona1&quot;/&gt;

Although they continued to have players of the standing of [[Josep Escolà]], the club now entered a period of decline, in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society. Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Jimmy. pp. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt; Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930, 1931, 1932, 1934, 1936 and 1938,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsssf1&quot;/&gt; success at a national level (with the exception of the [[Mediterranean League|1937 disputed title]]) evaded them.

A month after the [[Spanish Civil War]] began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;Arnaud, Pierre; Riordan, James. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 August, [[Falangist]] soldiers near [[Guadarrama]] murdered club president [[Josep Sunyol]], a representative of the pro-independence political party.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, Ramón. pp. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He was dubbed the martyr of ''barcelonisme'', and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking [[right of asylum|asylum]] in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Bill. p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 1938, Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the [[Italian Air Force]], causing more than 3,000 deaths, with one of the bombs hitting the club's offices.&lt;ref&gt;Raguer, Hilari. pp. 223–225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the &quot;undisciplined&quot; [[Catalanism]], the club, now down to just 3,486 members, faced a number of restrictions. All signs of regional nationalism, including language, flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain. The [[Senyera|Catalan flag]] was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names. These measures forced the club to change its name to ''Club de Fútbol Barcelona'' and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Jimmy. pp. 80–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the difficult political situation, ''CF Barcelona'' enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s. In 1945, with [[Josep Samitier]] as coach and players like [[César Rodríguez Alvarez|César]], [[Antoni Ramallets|Ramallets]] and [[Juan Zambudio Velasco|Velasco]], they won La Liga for the first time since 1929. They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lfp.es/Default.aspx?tabid=113&amp;Controltype=EvHist&amp;id=1&amp;tmpd=28&amp;tmph=110&amp;e1=5&amp;e2=&amp;e3=&amp;e4= |title=Evolution 1929–2010 |publisher=Liga de Fútbol Profesional |accessdate=6 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720042754/http://www.lfp.es/Default.aspx?tabid=113&amp;Controltype=EvHist&amp;id=1&amp;tmpd=28&amp;tmph=110&amp;e1=5&amp;e2=&amp;e3=&amp;e4= |archivedate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, they also won the first [[Latin Cup|Copa Latina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesl/latin.html |title=Latin Cup |publisher=Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation |date=23 November 2006|accessdate=12 June 2010|author1=Stokkermans, Karel |author2=Gorgazzi, Osvaldo José }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1950, Barcelona signed [[László Kubala]], who was to be an important figure at the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/jugadors_de_llegenda/kubala.html |title=Kubala |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=17 May 2002 |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a rainy Sunday of 1951, the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against [[Racing de Santander|Santander]] by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and surprising the [[Francoist]] authorities. The reason was simple: at the same time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of [[Supporters of FC Barcelona|blaugrana fans]]. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive [[Spaniards]] saw the club as a staunch defender of [[rights]] and [[freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrand, Alain; McCarthy, Scott. p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzig, Richard. p. 408&lt;/ref&gt;

Coach [[Ferdinand Daučík]] and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga, the Copa del Generalísimo, the [[Copa Latina]], the [[Supercopa de España|Copa Eva Duarte]], and the Copa Martini Rossi in 1952. In 1953, the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona2&quot;/&gt;

The 1960s were less successful for the club, with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga. The completion of the [[Camp Nou]], finished in 1957, meant the club had little money to spend on new players.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona3&quot;/&gt; The 1960s saw the emergence of [[Josep Maria Fusté]] and [[Carles Rexach]], and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966. Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] in front of [[Francisco Franco]], with coach [[Salvador Artigas]], a former republican pilot in the Civil War. With the end of Franco's dictatorship in 1974, the club changed its official name back to ''Futbol Club Barcelona'' and reverted the crest to its original design, including the original letters once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530060040/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/simbols/escut.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 May 2012 |title=The Crest |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=11 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eufo.de/football/esp/fc_blona.html|title=FC Barcelona – European football clubs &amp;amp; squads|accessdate=12 July 2008|publisher=Eufo.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of [[Johan Cruyff]], who was bought for a world record £920,000 from [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;MacWilliam, Rab; MacDonald, Tom. p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco.

He was crowned [[European Footballer of the Year]] in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona (his second Ballon d'Or win; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971).

In 1978, [[Josep Lluís Núñez]] became the first elected president of FC Barcelona, and, since then, the members of Barcelona have elected the club president. The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Romário]] and [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] rather than meeting their demands.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121204143800/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2012 |title=History part IV |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1979, the club won its first [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] by beating [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]] 4–3 in [[Basel]] in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling ''blaugrana'' fans. The same year, Núñez began to invest in the club's youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad. The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/la_Masia/lamasia.html |title=La Masia |accessdate=30 July 2010 |publisher=FC Barcelona |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091003171950/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/la_Masia/lamasia.html |archivedate= 3 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maradona Barcelona shirt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Diego Maradona]]'s ''blaugrana'' shirt on display in the [[FC Barcelona Museum]]]]
In June 1982, Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5&amp;nbsp;million from [[Boca Juniors]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobson, Stephen; Goddard, John A. p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; In the following season, under coach [[César Luis Menotti]], Barcelona won the Copa del Rey, beating Real Madrid. Maradona's time with Barcelona, however, was short-lived and he soon left for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]. At the start of the [[La Liga 1984-85|1984–85]] season, [[Terry Venables]] was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder [[Bernd Schuster]]. The next season, he took the team to their second [[1985–86 European Cup|European Cup]] [[1986 European Cup Final|final]], only to lose on penalties to [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]] during a dramatic evening in [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona4&quot;/&gt;

Around this time, tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez's dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group, [[Boixos Nois]]. The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in [[skinheads]], who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from [[liberalism]] to [[fascism]], which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, Ramón pp. 291–292&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, Ramón p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], Barcelona signed the English top scorer [[Gary Lineker]], along with goalkeeper [[Andoni Zubizarreta]], but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team. Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with [[Luis Aragonés]]. The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez, in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny, and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against [[Real Sociedad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona4&quot;/&gt;

It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was future Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article5950195.ece |author=Hawkey, Ian |work=The Times |accessdate=30 July 2010|title=Novelty factor adds spice to clash of giants|date=22 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Cruyff's guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat [[U.C.

They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the [[UEFA Super Cup|European Super Cup]] in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club's most successful manager at that point.

Reacting to Cruyff's departure, an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben, [[Joan Laporta]] and Alfons Godall.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;/&gt; The objective of the group, called ''L'Elefant Blau'', was to oppose the presidency of Núñez, which they regarded as a corruption of the club's traditional values.&lt;ref name=&quot;King&quot;&gt;King, Anthony pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt; Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joan Laporta on Barcelona, Beckham, Mourinho, Guardiola and Messi|url=http://www1.skysports.com/watch/tv-shows/revista-de-la-liga/news/8713233/joan-laporta-on-barcelona-beckham-mourinho-guardiola-and-messi|publisher=Sky Sports|date=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruyff was briefly replaced by [[Bobby Robson]], who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97. He recruited [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] for a world record transfer fee from his previous club, [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] and delivered a [[Treble (association football)|cup treble]], winning the Copa del Rey, [[1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and the Supercopa de España, with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ronaldo&quot;/&gt; Despite his success, Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for [[Louis van Gaal]] to become available.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_5.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121204192124/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_5.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2012 |title=History part V |publisher=FC Barcelona |date=15 June 2003 |accessdate=12 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the club celebrated its ''centenari'', winning the Primera División title, and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona5&quot;/&gt;

===2000–2008: Exit Núñez, enter Laporta===
[[File:Centenari Logotip.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Plaque commemorating the centenary of FC Barcelona]]
The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo, then club vice-captain. Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own. Barcelona fans, however, were distraught by Figo's decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid, and, during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou, Figo was given an extremely hostile reception. Upon his first return, a piglet's head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The next three years saw the club in decline, and managers came and went. Van Gaal was replaced by [[Lorenzo Serra Ferrer]] who, despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000, presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit, and was dismissed late in the season. Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement, initially on a temporary basis, and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from [[Rivaldo]], who completed arguably the [[Hat-trick#Association football|greatest hat-trick]] in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/19/barcelona.brazil|title=On Second Thoughts: Rivaldo|work=The Guardian|date=19 June 2008|accessdate=8 June 2014|quote=Best of all there was the greatest hat-trick of all time, against Valencia on June 17, 2001, a midsummer night's dream of a performance that deserves a book}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ranked!

Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League, Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager. What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by [[Radomir Antić]], though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Antić's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president [[Joan Gaspart]] resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] star [[Frank Rijkaard]], saw the club bounce back. On the field, an influx of international players, including [[Ronaldinho]], [[Deco]], [[Henrik Larsson]], [[Ludovic Giuly]], [[Samuel Eto'o]], [[Rafael Márquez]] and [[Edgar Davids]], combined with home grown Spanish players, such as [[Carles Puyol]], [[Andrés Iniesta]], [[Xavi]] and [[Víctor Valdés]], led to the club's return to success. Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in [[2004–05 FC Barcelona season|2004–05]], and Ronaldinho and Eto'o were voted first and third, respectively, in the [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/4486166.stm |title=Ronaldinho wins world award again |work=BBC Sport |date=19 December 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2005–06 FC Barcelona season|2005–06 season]], Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes. The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid. It was Rijkaard's second victory at the Bernabéu, making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice. Ronaldinho's performance was so impressive that after his second goal, which was Barcelona's third, some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/real-madrid-0-barcelona-3-bernabeu-forced-to-pay-homage-as-ronaldinho-soars-above-the-galacticos-516202.html|title=Real Madrid 0 Barcelona 3: Bernabeu forced to pay homage as Ronaldinho soars above the galacticos |work=The Independent|date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=11 August 2010 | location=London | first=Patrick | last=McCurdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Champions League, Barcelona beat the English club [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the final. Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining, they came back to win 2–1, with substitute Henrik Larsson, in his final appearance for the club, setting up goals for Samuel Eto'o and fellow substitute [[Juliano Belletti]], for the club's first European Cup victory in 14 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/4773353.stm |title=Barcelona 2–1 Arsenal |work=BBC Sport |date=17 May 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, about 25% of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers, second behind Real Madrid, supported by 32% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.es/cis/export/sites/default/-Archivos/Marginales/2700_2719/2705/Es2705mar_A.pdf |title=Ficha Técnica | publisher=Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas |date = May 2007|accessdate=8 August 2010|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Europe, Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, Simon; Arthur, Dave. pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The club's membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009,&lt;ref name=socis&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/20090919/barcelona-tiene-170000-socios/813866.shtml |title=El FC Barcelona ya tiene 170.000 socios |newspaper=Sport |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=19 September 2009 |first=Víctor |last=Aznar |accessdate=8 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314030154/http://www.sport.es/es/noticias/barca/20090919/barcelona-tiene-170000-socios/813866.shtml |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta's media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Peter. pp. 201–202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brott, Steffen. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Club rivalries ==

=== ''El Clásico'' ===
{{Main|El Clásico}}
[[File:Forcejeo Real Madrid - FC Barcelona.jpg|thumb|230px|Players jostle in Barcelona's 2–6 win against Real Madrid at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]] in a 2009 ''El Clásico'']]
There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as ''El Clásico''. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: [[Catalonia]] and [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between [[Catalan people|Catalans]] and the [[Castilians]], seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Ghemawat, Pankaj. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camp Nou during El Clasico October 2012.jpg|thumbnail|left|Barcelona fans creating a mosaic of the [[Senyera|Catalan flag]] before a 2012 ''El Clasico'' at the Camp Nou]]
During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera (1923–1930) and especially of Francisco Franco (1939–1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner-Liebau, Désirée. p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Phil |last=Ball |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/apr/21/championsleague.sport |title=The ancient rivalry of Barcelona and Real Madrid |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2002|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolising the Catalan people's desire for freedom, Barça became 'More than a club' (''Més que un club'') for the Catalans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/oct/02/barcelona-in-strange-and-symbolic-eye-of-a-storm-over-catalonia|title=Barcelona in the strange and symbolic eye of a storm over Catalonia |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=2 October 2017|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Manuel Vázquez Montalbán]], the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.&lt;ref&gt;Spaaij, Ramón. p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt; During Franco's regime, however, the ''blaugrana'' team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.as.com/actualidad/articulo/franco-recibio-medallas-barca/daspor/20031109dasdai_6/Tes|title=Franco recibió dos medallas del Barça |newspaper=Diario AS |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive [[centralism]] and the fascist regime at management level and beyond: [[Santiago Bernabéu Yeste|Santiago Bernabéu]], the former club president for whom their stadium is named, fought on the Nationalist side during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1697027,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429052637/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1697027,00.html |archivedate=29 April 2009 |title=Barcelona vs. Real Madrid: More Than a Game |date=20 December 2007 |accessdate=1 July 2009 |work=Time |last=Abend |first=Lisa |url-status=live  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/mar/26/newsstory.sport13|title=Morbo: The Story of Spanish Football by Phil Ball (London: WSC Books, 2001)|date=26 March 2001|accessdate=1 July 2009 |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |last=Lowe|first=Sid}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Spanish Civil War, however, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and [[Rafael Sánchez Guerra]] suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.

During the 1950s, the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a [[Alfredo Di Stéfano#Controversy surrounding transfer to Spain|controversy]] surrounding the transfer of [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Jimmy. pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup, with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee,&lt;ref name=&quot;ellis&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://elpais.com/diario/2002/04/23/deportes/1019512813_850215.html |title=De Mr. Ellis a Mr. Leafe |newspaper=El País |location=Madrid |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=21 May 2017 |author=Narrillos, Martín|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/apr/09/joy-of-six-el-clasico |title=The Joy of Six: Real Madrid v Barcelona El Clásico classics |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 April 2010 |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the &quot;Match of The Century&quot; by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500&amp;nbsp;million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7773773.stm |title=Real win Champions League showdown |work=BBC Sport |date=11 December 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to [[Goal celebration|memorable goal celebrations]] from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – one such notable celebration occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain [[Carles Puyol]] kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Real Madrid-Barcelona: Celebrations in enemy territory |url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2017/04/24/58fe5ed8ca47413f548b461c.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=Marca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''El derbi Barceloní'' ===
{{Main|Derbi barceloní}}

Barça's local rival has always been Espanyol. ''Blanc-i-blaus'', being one of the clubs granted royal patronage, was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans, unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil. pp. 86-87&quot;/&gt; The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;Shubert, Arthur. p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original ground was in the affluent district of [[Estadi de Sarrià|Sarrià]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.lavanguardia.com/preview/1901/04/09/pagina-2/33398307/pdf.html |title=Edición del martes, 09 abril 1901, página 2 – Hemeroteca – Lavanguardia.es |language=Spanish|publisher=Hemeroteca Lavanguardia|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcdespanyol.cat/principal.php?modulo=estatico&amp;idcontenido=8&amp;idmenu=2&amp;idsubmenu=22&amp;nombremodulo=dates&amp;idlinkchk=21 |title=History of Espanyol |publisher=RCD Espanyol |accessdate=13 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928223937/http://rcdespanyol.cat/principal.php?modulo=estatico&amp;idcontenido=8&amp;idmenu=2&amp;idsubmenu=22&amp;nombremodulo=dates&amp;idlinkchk=21 |archivedate=28 September 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, in stark contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iss.europa.eu/index.php?id=18&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpointer%5D=41&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=697&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=232&amp;tx_ttnews%5Bpage%5D=1&amp;cHash=2becc765c6|title=European football cultures and their integration: the 'short' Twentieth Century|date=March 2002|accessdate=1 July 2009|work=Europa (web portal)|last=Missiroli|first=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the [[Franco regime|regime]] such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]], September 1997, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy, which at that time had become a pertinent issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil. pp. 86-87&quot;&gt;Ball, Phil. pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the ''derbi'' has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ball, Phil. pp. 86-87&quot;/&gt;

Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga, it is also the most unbalanced, with Barcelona overwhelmingly [[El derbi barcelones#Head to Head|dominant]]. In the primera división league table, Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 81 seasons (1928–2016) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça [[1957 Copa del Generalísimo Final|in 1957]]. Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951, while Barcelona's biggest win was 5–0 on six occasions (in 1933, 1947, 1964, 1975, 1992 and 2016). Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season, becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning [[2008–09 FC Barcelona season|season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/temporada_08-09/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada24/Barcelona_Espanyol/partit.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731081930/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/futbol/temporada_08-09/arxiu_partits/lliga/jornada24/Barcelona_Espanyol/partit.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Matchday 24 |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=13 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FC Barcelona 1910 logo.png|thumb|The second Barcelona crest, designed by Carles Comamala in 1910]]
The club's original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the [[Crown of Aragon]] and the [[Bat (heraldry)#The bat in official heraldry|bat of King James]], and surrounded by two branches, one of a laurel tree and the other a palm.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt; The club shared [[Coat of arms of Barcelona|Barcelona's coat of arms]], as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/detail/card/1899-the-first-coat-of-arms |title=1899.

The winner was Carles Comamala, who at the time played for the club. Comamala's suggestion became the crest that the club wears today, with some minor variations. The crest consists of the [[St George's Cross|St George Cross]] in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it, and the team colours at the bottom.&lt;ref name=crest/&gt;

The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against [[Hispania]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, [[Arthur Witty]], claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby|Merchant Taylor's School]] team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's [[French First Republic|First Republic]]. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, [[FC Basel]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.

Since 1998, the club has had a kit deal with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]. In 2016, the deal was renewed until 2028, for a record [[Euro|€]]155 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/barcelona-sign-record-kit-deal-with-nike-103016 Barcelona sign new kit deal with Nike that is biggest in the world]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11833/10637904/barcelona-confirm-record-kit-deal-with-nike Barcelona confirm record kit deal with Nike]&lt;/ref&gt;

The capacity was about 6,000, and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/catala/noticies/club/temporada08-09/03/n090314107593.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804055554/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/catala/noticies/club/temporada08-09/03/n090314107593.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 August 2012 |publisher=FC Barcelona |title=Cent anys del camp de la Indústria |accessdate=11 September 2010 |date=14 March 2009 |author=Santacana, Carles |language=Catalan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club, Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts, which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators. After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950. After the last expansion, Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/CampNou/intro_historica.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120801083203/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/club/club_avui/territori_barca/CampNou/intro_historica.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 August 2012 |title=Brief history of Camp Nou |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=30 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts. Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950, who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches, drew larger crowds to the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farred, Grant. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eaude, Michael. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The club began to make plans for a new stadium.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;/&gt; The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954, before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans. The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288&amp;nbsp;million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]], 336% over budget.&lt;ref name=&quot;fcbarcelona6&quot;/&gt;

[[File:2014. Més que un club. Camp Nou. Barcelona B38.jpg|right|thumb|The words &quot;Més que un club&quot; are painted in yellow on the blue seats of the stadium|One of the Camp Nou stands displays Barcelona's motto, ''&quot;Més que un club&quot;'', meaning 'More than a club'.]]

In 1980, when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria, the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee. The idea was popular with supporters, and thousands of people paid the fee. Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Phil pp. 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Bill. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, John. pp. 81–2.&lt;/ref&gt; It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;stadium&quot;/&gt;

There are also other facilities, which include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/castellano/noticies/club/temporada09-10/07/n090728107768.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731095844/http://www.fcbarcelona.cat/web/castellano/noticies/club/temporada09-10/07/n090728107768.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 July 2009 |title=El proyecto Barça Parc, adelante |accessdate=28 July 2009 |year=2009 |language=Spanish |publisher=FC Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt;
